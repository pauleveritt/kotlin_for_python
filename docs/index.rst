Kotlin for Python Developers
============================

Kotlin: it's new, it's hot, it's exciting! If you're a Python developer,
you might be interested in Kotlin for Android development. If you're
a PyCharm user, you might want to write an IDE plugin, using Kotlin.

In both cases, you're looking to add Kotlin to your programming arsenal.
This documentation teaches Kotlin -- from the perspective of a Python
developer who knows nothing about Kotlin, Java, Gradle, or the JVM.
